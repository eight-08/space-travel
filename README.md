Space Tourism Challenge from Frontend Monitor

I am a beginner programmer learning web dev for the last 1 month.
I started this challenge without any prior knowledge of JavaScript.

This website has been made purely using HTML and CSS with little bits of JavaScript.
It is not responsive. Only for desktop monitors (Need to learn how to do it first).
This is pure HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks, no tools.
Hope you like it ;)

Learnt a lot from this challenge. It was my first one on Frontend Monitor.
Looking forward to doing more
